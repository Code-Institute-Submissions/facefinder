# FaceFinder
 Clive Noonan , Full Stack Student In CODE INSTITUTE

- I am currently a student at the Code Institute Studing Full Stack Diploma in Software Development. 
- This is the third of five projects which I must complete in order to be awarded the globally recognised Diploma 
- from Edinburgh Napier University. This Project utilises The Front End Technology React.js the postgress SQL query Language
- & the exspress middleware  technology .

- This project is based on a Image Recognition  Machine learning API , it utlilises the clarifaiAPI,
- the inspiration for this application came from many years  when I first saw the clarifaiAPI been advertised ,
- I was amazed at the power & potentiol of this technology,
- its great that I get the chance to focus my new found knowledge on a idea I was so interested in.

- It uses the postgres database which is still one of the most popular & wildly used for development , coupled with the exspress middleware - framework & the react,js frontend framework, these technologys stack up beautifully to be an enormously powerfull application, 

 
## UX

The theme of this website is geared towards the AI Community, the Particle.js background is indented, to be space & futuristic like, 

- The content is very minmal, this project is purely based on the react.js view

- liberary to create the frontend  & the exspress middleware framework for bridging our gap between our database, our server

- & our FronEnd a triangle of technologys seemlesly integrating, this all happens behind the scenes

- With the use of tachyons , it was very easy to style with minimil code & the design of this application should reflect the small amount

- of css code it took to style it , very minmal but very effective ,

- while the background is very a lot , a quick use of the application &

- its power soon balances out the whole application into one application,

- There is also a rank fearture in this project that lets the user know how many time they have submitted a url for face dedection

- The register & signin is also very minimil , with the indent to get the user into the appliaction asap, 

- The logo is indented to reflect the theme of the site, futuristic & bionic like, with a mind of its own if you will 

- My Application is very easy to use , it is just a matter of copy & pasting a valid image url from google images & pasting it back into
- The dedect box & watch the magic happen ,

- My Application looks amazingon all screnn sizes , this is down to react responsivness 
- My Application is build for the desktop & tablet, it is not very user freindly on the mobile device ,
- while it possible to achieve the task of the operation, it is not a very easy expeirence, it was built for the desktop , it is
- not very user freindly on the laptop , as a user has to manully copy & paste useing the touch pad or shift & arrows
- again not very user freindly ,
- Where this application really shines is on the desktop with the mouse,

- You can see the power of FaceFinder here

## Features
## clarifaiAPI
- The Main Fearture of this application is the clarifaiAPI.
- clarifai is a machine learning api free of charge,
- It trains models in millions pictures of one subject to regcognise just about anything

## React.js
- The FrontEnd
- I built this using react.js, with create react app command , after my boiler plate project was created,
- I cut out the contents of app.js , & kept the component function
- I Started the development server with npm start
- First I installed Tachyons with npm install tachyons & imported them in to my index.js
- I also installed particle.js with npm install react-particles
- I then created my components
- My Navigaation
- My Logo -- I installed React-tilt.js to interact with my logo & saved as a dev, then imported into my logo component
- My ImageLink Form
- My Face Recognition -- I installed clarifiy with npm & imported into my app.js
- My Signin
- My Register
- My Rank
- Next I imported my components into my Navigation.js ,FaceRecognition.js ,Logo.js ,ImagelinkForm.js ,Registration.js ,Signin.js
- Rank.js 
- This was an amazing way to develop, reusable React components , the dry methodology 
- I aslo imported all these components into my app.js
- Next I created my css files & styled my project, with main styles in index.css, which effect my intire app


## postgresDatabase
- The Database
- First I needed to start my database server in my pgAdmin management console, while this was running
- Next I had to have both my frontend project/facefinder & my backend/face-finder-backend-api
- running on there own local development servers,I did this with Visual studio Code terminals,
- this is with the front end already coded & setup to connect to my application
- postgres uses sql to communicate with my express server requests
- For the database in my project I chose the rational database postgres , in order to achieve this I needed to install pgAdmin3,
- to manage my database,
- after installation I needed to create my [database], I acccomplished this with both the postsql cli & pgAdmin3 ,
- Next I needed to map out my schema, once I was ready to build
- Next I created my tables to create my columns by inserting my sql statements in pgAdmin3, for ease of use
- I accomplished this by creating a joined table, between the users table & the login table
- they will be programaticly connected through the emal field 
- I created my user, by inserting my sql statements in pgAdmin3, for ease of use
- Next I tested my application by restarting both development severs
- my Express server is now connected to my database & is also responding back to my front end
- all these operations had to be carried out simultaneously
- In my local env the application is operating 100%



## Node.js & NPM 
- The Robot
- I used Node.js & NPM as a package manager to install my modules & creates my package.json
- & with node everything runs in the browser 
- Heroku will need my package.json to rebuild my project
- Node is also what gives us the abitly to build the backend server in express



## Exspress.js
- The Server
- I Installed express with node & npm
- I used the express module in node to build the backend server in express with the require function, 
- I programmed the server to listen on port 3000
- I succesfully started my development server
- began testing & buiding my backend server



## THE FUTURE
##### I hope to develop on this project in the future to train a model to dedect recthangles, then I can extract the shapes with software such Adobe ai, I can then use these shapes the create isomorphic designs, example would be point the model at a skyline & extract the shapes & then build the isomorphic city.
##### Get 100% in LightHouse
##### Dockerisation for greater speed & performance
##### A more sophisticated authentication system

## Deployment

- To deploy this application/project the first task is to make sure my project is version controlled with GitHub
- I needed to depoy my front end & backend
- backend was first up with the use of the HerokuCLI, I created an heroku app from the command line
- by running the git remote -v command I could calrify my heroku address
- Then I Git add ./Git commit -m ""/ Git push/ Git push heroku master
- Heroku will build my app with my node modules packgage.json file
- After Success Heroku gave me the end point for my fetch function for my app.js & register & images urls
- In completing this task I pointed the frontend to the location of the server,that was provided by heroku
- Next I had to rebuild my database, I did this in the herokuCLI by running heroku pg:sql
- this opened up my heroku psql cli inside of heroku
- Then I went back to my pgAdmin & copied my statements from database schema
- With the pgsql cli runninig I inserted my schema into my database which was on heroku

## Deployment part2
- Next task was to deploy my front end on heroku
- So once again I creatd an app from the HerokuCli
- then I retrived my heroku.git address
- Next I needed to
- Then I Git add ./Git commit -m ""/ Git push/ Git push heroku master

## VERSION CONTROL
  The backend project folder lives at this address
  [github](https://github.com/90t/publish)

  The frontend project folder lives at this address
  [github](https://github.com/90t/public) <------ THIS IS THE LIVE PROJECT FOLDER 

  ## My front end project can be viewed fully deployed on heroku [here](https://face-finder-front-end.herokuapp.com/).

  ## My backend project can be viewed fully deployed on heroku [here](https://face-finder-backend-api.herokuapp.com/).
  


- I added my env vars in the heroku cloud managment console in the settings section,
- I created a viarible named CLARAFIAI_API in my backend project 

- heroku  https://git.heroku.com/face-finder-backend-api.git (fetch)
- heroku  https://git.heroku.com/face-finder-backend-api.git (push)
- origin  https://github.com/90t/face-finder-server.git (fetch)
- origin  https://github.com/90t/face-finder-server.git (push)


- Different configuration files?
