 Clive Noonan , Full Stack Student In CODE INSTITUTE

- I am currently a student at the Code Institute Studing Full Stack Diploma in Software Development. 
- This is the third of five projects which I must complete in order to be awarded the globally recognised Diploma 
- from Edinburgh Napier University. This Project utilises The Front End Technology React.js the postgress SQL query Language
- & the exspress middleware  technology .

- This project is based on a Image Recognition  Machine learning API , it utlilises the clarifaiAPI,
- the inspiration for this application came from many years  when I first saw the clarifaiAPI been advertised ,
- I was amazed at the power & potentiol of this technology,
- its great that I get the chance to focus my new found knowledge on a idea I was so interested in.

- It uses the postgres database which is still one of the most popular & wildly used for development , coupled with the exspress middleware - framework & the react,js frontend framework, these technologys stack up beautifully to be an enormously powerfull application, 

 
## UX

The theme of this website is geared towards the AI Community, the Particle.js background is indented, to be space & futuristic like, 

- The content is very minmal, this project is purely based on the react,js

- liberary to create the frontend  & the exspress middleware framework for bridging our gap between our database, our server

- & our FronEnd a triangle of technologys seemlesly integrating, this all happens behind the scenes

- With the use of tachyons , it was very easy to style with minimil code & the design of this application should reflect the small amount

- of css code it took to style it , very minmal but very effective ,

- while the background is very a lot , a quick use of the application &

- its power soon balances out the whole application into one application,

- The register & signin is also very minimil , with the indent to get the user into the appliaction asap, 

- The logo is indented to reflect the theme of the site, futuristic & bionic like, with a mind of its own if you will 

- My Application is very easy to use , it is just a matter of copy & pasting a valid image url from google images & pasting it back into
- The dedect box & watch the magic happen ,

- My Application is build for the desktop & tablet, it is not very user freindly on the mobile device ,
- while it possible to achieve the task of the operation, it is not a very easy expeirence, it was built for the desktop , it is
- not very user freindly on the laptop , as a user has to manully copy & paste useing the touch pad or shift & arrows
- again not very user freindly ,
- Where this application really shines is on the desktop with the mouse,

## Features
## clarifaiAPI
- The Main Fearture of this apllication is the clarifaiAPI.

## Node.js
- The Robot

## React.js
- The FrontEnd

## Exspress.js
- The Server

## THE FUTURE
##### I hope to develop on this project in the future to train a model to dedect recthangles, then I can extract the shapes with software such Adobe ai, I can then use these shapes the create isomorphic designs, example would be point the model at a skyline & extract the shapes & then build the isomorphic city.
##### Get 100% in LightHouse
##### Dockerisation for greater speed & performance
##### A more sophisticated authentication system

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

####You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.###****

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

- To deploy this application/project the first task is to make sure my project is version controlled with GitHub



- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)? Need to do
- Different configuration files?

- heroku  https://git.heroku.com/face-finder-front-end.git 
- heroku  https://git.heroku.com/face-finder-front-end.git 
- origin  https://github.com/90t/facefinder.git 
- origin  https://github.com/90t/facefinder.git 

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
